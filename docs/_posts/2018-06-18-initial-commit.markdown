Hey team!

I don't really have a theme for this. I literally made this just to see if I could get a blog up and running.
Let's see where this goes.

My name is Michael. I write a lot at work about my day because I have a really bad memory. I forget what I did the day before. Sometimes I forget what I had for dinner last night. (It was probably chili. I'm always making chili. Honestly though, beans are so great! Fibre and protein in a compact package!)

Anyway, I figured its time I transformed my approach to memory keeping, and I figured I'd throw it online too, because that's the cool thing to do, right? I'm still going to keep making pen and paper notes about my day though, because writing is a fun break from work.

My work! Currently I'm employed at an airline company (the only national airline in New Zealand, hint hint). I'm a software engineering intern as part of the booking team (but it'd be nice if they can offer me a proper position). I really enjoy working with my team - sounds kind of mushy, but my team are just the right level of supportive while kicking me out of my comfort zone. 

Something I'd like to note is that my team has been really good with the adoption of Agile and maturing towards CI/CD. Sometimes I think it could be nice to join a startup where we can do cool things and use the latest methodologies straight away, but I think there's something positive to be said about being around to observe the transformation of companies and teams.

I live in New Zealand, in Auckland, in an apartment complex in Onehunga. That's probably all you need to know about that.

I'm not too sure about what else to put here.  
I like video games and music.  
I enjoy watching anime and Netflix.  
I like drinks and good food.  
I want to live in Melbourne, and visit Tokyo.  
My partner is in Los Angeles.  
I got a lot of things I wanna achieve.  
I got goals for my career, I got goals for my community, and I got goals for myself.

That's probably enough for an initial commit.
