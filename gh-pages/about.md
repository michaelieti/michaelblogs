Software Engineering graduate from the University of Auckland.  
Born in New Zealand to Samoan immigrants in the hospital of Middlemore.  
Literally just finished my degree. Trying to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.  
Not really sure what I'm doing half the time, but maybe that's a good thing.  

Find my github repo at the bottom. It's full of tutorial projects and half-baked projects. I feel like everyone's github repo is though, they just don't want you to see it.

My twitter is also at the bottom, though I rarely use it.

Built this using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). If I build this, you can too!

In my spare time I play video games and go to the gym (and then delete all my progress by eating lots of food).
